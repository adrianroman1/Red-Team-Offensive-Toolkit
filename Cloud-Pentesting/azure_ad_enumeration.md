# ☁️ Azure AD & O365 Security Assessment Methodology

## 1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration
- **Targeting O365:** Using tools like `aad-abort` or `O365Recon` to validate valid usernames without triggering lockouts.
- **Tenant ID Discovery:** Extracting Tenant ID from public OpenID configurations.

## 2. Privilege Escalation in Azure
- **Key Vault Analysis:** Searching for "Secrets" and "Certificates" that might contain deployment credentials.
- **Managed Identities:** Checking if an Azure VM has a System-Assigned Identity that can be used to pivot to other resources.

## 3. Post-Exploitation
- **Global Admin Hunting:** Analyzing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to identify path to Global Administrator.
- **Persistence:** Researching "App Registrations" with high privileges for long-term access.
